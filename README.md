# Dolphins_VS_Koalas
A JavaScript program that finds an average between two teams (Team Dolphins and Team Koalas) and announces winners for the number of test cases

<h2>JavaScript coding challenge</h2>

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using
the test data below

2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the
winner of the competition, and print it to the
console. Don't forget that there can be a draw,
so test for that as well (draw means they have the same
average score).

<strong>Optional:</strong> Include a requirement for a minimum score
of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a
higher score than the other team, and the same time
score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical
operator to test for minimum score, as well as
multiple else-if blocks

Minimum score also applies to a draw! So
a draw only happens when both teams have the same
score and both have a score greater or equal 100
points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.
